    <h3>Database Project</h3>
    <p>
        Designed a complete database to manage affairs for the Ink It Foundations' Mobile Library Project. <br>
        The database had records of schools, students and communities to manipulate data on the stakeholders of the project. <br>
        It also contained details on books and literary material used, logistics, and other inventory. <br>
        Records on employees, teachers and parents were also created. <br>
        One could perform queries to find number of schools available on a day, salaries of workers and work schedules.
